# Python program(places where films were made)
This is a GitHub page of my university project. It was a homework task to make a map which will show in which places were made films on some year(which user can input) and also to see what are those films. All this you can see in the Map.html(Here as input I used 2017 year, 25 places, and max 20 films for one place) file. To make this task I used Python and some additional libraries(folium, geopy), wrote my own parser to read films, year and their place and also learned how to use JSON files.
